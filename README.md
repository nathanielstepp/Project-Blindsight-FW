# Project-Blindsight-FW
Firmware for ESP32-CAM-based hardware to support efforts of Project Blindsight: a low-cost, easy-to-use, plug-and-play localized visual telepresence solution, catered to the hobby/profession of cosplay for instances where the specific cosplay obscures direct line-of-sight and/or peripheral vision (e.g., a helmet with poor visibility).
